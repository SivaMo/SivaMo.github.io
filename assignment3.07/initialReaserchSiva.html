      <h4>Many teens and adults feel isolated from comunity spaces.</h4>
      <h4>We need to create acces for citizens to comunity spaces and reasourses</h4>
      <h5> According to the National Institute for Health, A study published by the Harvard Graduate School of Education found that 36% of people surveyed said they experienced severe loneliness "frequently" or "almost all the time." In addition to this, third places have long been an important part of American culture and their role continues to evolve.
        Public places like parks provide a space for children to independently play and have social interactions, which in turn provide opportunities to improvise a social life, and learn social skills. The lack of third spaces affects the unused population of big cities like Oakland. And this issue impacts the mental health of all citizens. According to CBS news (a left leaning media source) Many people see the problem as mostly affecting adults working from home, but others see it as a problem affecting kids and teens. Although, some argue third places cause harm, according to the American Sociological Association, "third places may be inequitably distributed, thereby exacerbating disparities in social capital and mobility." But contrary to this, the goal of this project would be to increase accessibility to third places. Promoting free and publicly available third places.
